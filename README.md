# CodeWatch project!

## What is CodeWatch? And what for?

CodeWatch project is real time code watching web service. When we study
programming, we often use Stackoverflow. But asking and answering take time. If
we have enough time, well, yeah, it's ok. But when homework deadline is 24:00
today, it's not OK at all.

I thought 'If someone can answer while someone writing, it will be cool!'. And I
also needed to study Node.js, Express, socket.io, etc while summer vacation. So,
I decide to make CodeWatch.

## How to use?

First sign up, log in, make Watch and have fun! In real time code, you can chat
while someone writing. And in ended code, you can comment for that. That's
it. This project is very simple.
