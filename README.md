CodeWatch project!
---

### What is CodeWatch? and what for?  
CodeWatch project is real time code watching web service.  
When we study programming, we often use Stackoverflow. But asking and answering take time.  
If we have enough time, well, yeah, it's ok. But when homework deadline is today 24:00, it's not OK at all.  

I thought "If someone can ansewr while someone writing, it will be cool!".  
And i need to study node.js, express, socket.io, etc while summer vacation.
So! i decide to make CodeWatch.

### How to use?  
First sign up, log in, make Watch and have fun!
In real time code, you can chat while someone writing.  
And in ended code, you can comment for that.  
That's it. This project is very simple.
